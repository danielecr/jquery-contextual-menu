jquery-contextual-menu
======================

I upload this even if I am a bit late, a number of person hint for modification in the past, maybe now it have loose the appeal it has had at the moment.

The project home is in http://www.smartango.com/articles/jquery-context-menu
This is just the javascript part


As test.html shows, this is not working, at least with html5 doctype, also html5 has its own standard for context menu, a fallback pluging is probably available elsewhere.
